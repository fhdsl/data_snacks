Learn more about composing plots together with a package with straightforward syntax.

## Learning Objectives

After working with this Data Snack you should be able to:

- **Explain** how the `{patchwork}` package lets you compose plots together
- **Utilize** `{patchwork}` to compose multiple plots in various layouts

## What is `{patchwork}`?

The `{patchwork}` package solves a problem that many of us have: 

> how do we compose multiple plots together into a single figure?

## Penguins Data

Just a quick reminder of the penguins data:

```{webr}
#| edit: false
data(penguins)
library(gt)

gt(head(penguins))
```

## Let's start with two plots

Let's make two different views of the `palmerpenguins` data. The first is a bar plot of the penguin `species`:

```{webr}
#| autorun: false
library(palmerpenguins)
library(ggplot2)

penguin_species <- ggplot(penguins, aes(y=species, fill=species)) +
  geom_bar(color="black")

penguin_species
```

Let's do a histogram of penguin `bill_length_mm`, colored by `species`:

```{webr}
#| autorun: false
penguin_bill_length <- ggplot(penguins, aes(y=bill_length_mm, fill=species)) +
  geom_histogram()

penguin_bill_length
```

# Composing Plots together

Now that we have our two plots, let's combine them into a single plot. 

The {patchwork} package has two basic operations. `+` composes the plots side by side, and `/` composes one plot on top of each other.

Let's try out a side by side composition:

```{webr}
#| autorun: false
library(patchwork)
penguin_species + penguin_bill_length
```

Let's try stacking the plots on top of each other:

```{webr}
#| autorun: false
penguin_species / penguin_bill_length
```

We can remove the legends from both:

```{webr}
#| autorun: false
(penguin_species + theme(legend.position="none")) /
  (penguin_bill_length + theme(legend.position="none"))
```

## Side by side and Stacked

How about three figures? We can compose them with a combination of `+` and `/`:

```{webr}
#| autorun: false
penguin_island <- ggplot(penguins, aes(y=island)) +
  geom_bar()

(penguin_species + penguin_island) / penguin_bill_length
```

There is an equivalent syntax of using `|` (the pipe character), which does the same thing as `+`:

```{webr}
#| autorun: false
(penguin_species | penguin_island) / penguin_bill_length
```

## Plot Labeling

You can automatically label plots in your figure using `plot_annotation()`:

```{webr}
#| autorun: false
(penguin_species + penguin_island) / penguin_bill_length + 
    plot_annotation(tag_levels="A")
```

Finally, let's add a title for our figure:

```{webr}
#| autorun: false
(penguin_species + penguin_island) / penguin_bill_length + 
  plot_annotation(tag_levels="A") +
  plot_annotation(title="Penguins are Very Surprising")
```
## Try it out!

Try out a different combination of plots, such as one plot on top and another on the bottom. Or make your own `penguins` plot and compose them.

```{webr}
#| autorun: false

```
