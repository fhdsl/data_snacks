## Need a Table 1?

When making tables for publication, one of the most common ones we need are Table 1's: the summarization of our study populations in terms of demographics.

Oftentimes, this would require tedious formatting in something like Word or Excel, especially when we want to include confidence intervals in the same cell, and of course, we need to calculate p-values between groups.

Well, Daniel Sjoberg's `{gtsummary}` package is here to save you a lot of work!

## Learning Objectives

- **Explain** the major use case of `{gtsummary}`
- **Utilize** `{gtsummary}` features to summarize your cohort
- **Output** `{gtsummary}` tables in a variety of formats

## Our Cohort: Penguins

We're going to use the `palmerpenguins` dataset as our example cohort. As a reminder, here's the first few rows of this dataset.

```{webr}
#| edit: false
library(palmerpenguins)
library(gtsummary)
library(dplyr)

gt(head(penguins))
```

## Summary Table of Penguins

`{gtsummary}` lets you build up a summary demographics table with `dplyr` commands and special summarization commands. 

Here, we're 

```{webr}
#| autorun: false
penguins |>
  select(species, island, bill_length_mm) |>
  tbl_summary()
```

## Comparing Groups

```{webr}
penguins |>
  tbl_summary(include=c(island, bill_length_mm),
              by=species,
              missing="no")

```

We can also add N's and P-values:

```{webr}
penguins |>
  tbl_summary(include=c(island, bill_length_mm),
              by=species,
              missing="no") |>
  add_n() |>
  add_p()

```
