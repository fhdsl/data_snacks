This is a collection of cool data tricks with R and Python from the [Fred Hutch Data Science Lab](https://hutchdatascience.org/). We leverage a technology called `quarto-live` to give you runnable R and Python examples in your browser, no installation needed. So you can immediately start experimenting with the new tips and tricks.

Think of these snacks like experiments - they may grow into something bigger, or they may just stay as little nuggets of data science.
