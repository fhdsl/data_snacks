A wordcloud is a simple data visualization tool for looking at frequency of text data, and quickly answers what are some of the most common words that show up in a body of text by the font size. We show how to make wordclouds via the `wordcloud` Python module. 

## Show your data

We download US Presidential State of the Union speeches as a demo dataset - from Washington to Obama.

```{pyodide}
from wordcloud import WordCloud
import matplotlib.pyplot as plt

with open('state_union_part1.txt', 'r') as file:
    text1 = file.read()

with open('state_union_part2.txt', 'r') as file:
    text2 = file.read()

text = text1 + text2

print("Here's an example section of the text:", text[6030:6400])
```

## Demonstrate wordcloud

```{pyodide}
# Generate a word cloud image
wordcloud = WordCloud(max_font_size=40).generate(text)

# Display the generated image:
plt.imshow(wordcloud, interpolation='bilinear')
plt.axis("off")
plt.show()
```

## Your turn!

What happens when you change the `max_font_size`?

```{pyodide}
#| exercise: ex_1
wordcloud2 = WordCloud(max_font_size=______).generate(text)

# Display the generated image:
plt.imshow(wordcloud2, interpolation='bilinear')
plt.axis("off")
plt.show()
```
