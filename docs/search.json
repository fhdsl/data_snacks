In this example, you can see that cereals are missing mascots; in our case, we expect this because we merged in a list of cereal mascots and not every cereal has a mascot.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nIn this example, reading the combinations from left to right, we can see:\n\n9 penguins had missing values for sex\n2 penguins had missing values in bill_length, bill_depth, flipper_length, body_mass, and sex.\n\nVisualizing the combinations of missing values helps us discover patterns of association in missingness that we don’t expect."

This shadow matrix lets you do clever things such as visualize two continuous variables on a plot but include those missing values to assess whether those missing values are MNAR, MAR, or MCAR.\nWhen you are plotting two continuous values, you need to be curious about whether there are biases in the missingness. geom_miss_point() gives us a way to visualize the missing values when we plot.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nIn this plot, the missing values are represented by red points that are below the zero line for both axes (they are jittered so they don’t all occupy the same line). Specifically, the points on the left side have values for Solar.R but are missing values for Ozone. In this case, the points are distributed across the entire range of Solar.R. Note that this isn’t the case for missing values of Solar.R, which are represented in the lower right of the plot. These missing values are not distributed evenly across Ozone, showing a bias towards lower values of Ozone.\nful when you facet on a categorical variable, to look for conditioned randomness, MAR/MNAR.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nHere we can see a possible bias in missing values by the month (compare month=6 to month=9)."
