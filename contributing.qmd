## Want to Contribute a Snack?

We always welcome contributions! Please note that we follow the [WILDS contributor guide](https://getwilds.org/guide/) in terms of reviewing contributions. 

What makes a good snack? A good snack is about something that makes your day to day life easier. This could be a single function, or an entire package.

## Set Up Quarto

We're using RStudio to build the website, but you can also work in Visual Studio Code or other IDEs.

Follow the instructions to set up Quarto for your IDE at [quarto.org](https://quarto.org)

## Fork Our Repo to Add a Snack

You'll want to fork the `data_snacks` repository to get started: <https://github.com/fhdsl/data_snacks/>.

Then create a branch with your edits.

## R Snack Template

[An example of an R Snack is here](https://github.com/fhdsl/data_snacks/blob/main/snack_template.qmd). Copy this into the `r_snacks/` folder to get started.

Add a preview image in `/r_snacks/images/` to make your post more enticing, and then add it to the `image: ` field in your snack. For example, if your image is `/r_snacks/images/my_plot.png`, then the front matter should look like this:

```
---
title: My Cool Snack
image: images/my_plot.png
[...]
---
```

## Python Snack Template

An example of a Python Snack is here. 

Add a preview image in `/python_snacks/images/` to make your post more enticing.

## Make Sure the Site Builds

In your folder, run:

```
quarto preview . 
```
